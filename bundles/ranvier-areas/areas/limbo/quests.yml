    A voice whispers to you: It would be wise to practice protecting yourself. There are a number of training dummies in this area that, while not pushovers, will not be too difficult.
    - Use '{white attack dummy}' to start combat against the training dummy
    - Once it's dead any loot it drops will be in its corpse on the ground. You can use '{white look in corpse}' to check again or '{white loot corpse}' to retrieve all your loot.
  completionMessage: |-
    {bold {cyan Hint: You can get the loot from enemies with '{white get <item> corpse}' but be quick about it, the corpse will decay after some time.}
